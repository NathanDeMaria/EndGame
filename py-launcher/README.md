# EndGame Launcher

A Python application launcher for EndGame, that'll launch the jobs via [my AWS Batch package](https://github.com/NathanDeMaria/aws-batch-optimization/tree/main/batch-core).

There'll also be a few light tools for checking the results, and hopefully eventually this is where I'd schedule the launcher.
